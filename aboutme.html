  <p>My name is <b>Ally Zitzka</b>. I was born in <b>Redmond, Washington</b>, on <b>September 5, 2000</b>. My mom's name is Susan and my dad's name is August. I moved to <b>Mukilteo</b> around age 5. At the same time, my parents got divorced and my dad moved to Texas. I have one older sister. Her name is Zoe. I currently have <b>two dogs</b>, Molly and Mohawk, and <b>one cat</b>, Lucky. In elementary school, I generally got very good grades. In middle school, I joined a <b>highly-capable program</b>. Because of this, school was much more challenging than I was used to and my grades fell slightly. With time, I learned to manage the increased work load. In high school, I attemded <b>Kamiak High School</b>. So far I've had very good grades, only struggling occasionally. I plan on attending <b>University of Washington</b>, but I haven't decided what to study yet.</p>
