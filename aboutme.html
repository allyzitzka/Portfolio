  <article>
  <p>My name is Ally Zitzka. I was born in Redmond, Washington, on September 5, 2000. My mom's name is Susan and my dad's name is August. I moved to Mukilteo around age 5. At the same time, my parents got divorced and my dad moved to Texas. I have one older sister. Her name is Zoe. I currently have two dogs, Molly and Mohawk, and one cat, Lucky. In elementary school, I generally got very good grades. In middle school, I joined a highly-capable program. Because of this, school was much more challenging than I was used to and my grades fell slightly. With time, I learned to manage the increased work load. In high school, I attemded Kamiak High School. So far I've had very good grades, only struggling occasionally. I plan on attending University of Washington, but I haven't decided what to study yet.</p>
